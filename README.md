# E-commerce-Demand-Prediction

This project is for a company which sells sports equipment across the EU. They sell equipment in more than a dozen countries across the EU. The aim is predicting how many of different items will be sold in the near future (next day, next week, next month). 

This is a time series prediction problem where we need to create predictions for various combinations of different product types and markets. With accurate sales predictions on each item for each location the logistics and purchase teams can plan accordingly to avoid bottlenecks in the distribution.
