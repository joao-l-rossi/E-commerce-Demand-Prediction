# E-commerce-Demand-Prediction

The goal of this project is to forecast items demand for one of the biggest sportswear e-commerce companies, selling equipment in more than a dozen of countries in Europe. The aim is predicting how many of different items will be sold in the near future (next day, next week, next month). 

This is a time series prediction problem where predictions are required for various combinations of different product types and markets. With accurate sales predictions on each item for each location the logistics and purchase teams can plan accordingly to avoid bottlenecks in the distribution.

Facebook Prophet was the model used for predictions and the code includes hyper-parameter tuning at each series level. The final product was a dashboard created in streamlit that presents the series forecast and metrics for next day, next week and next month.
