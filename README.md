Top4Sport Demand Prediction

This project is for the company top4sport which sells sports equipment across the EU. They operate out of the Czech Republic and sell equipment in more than a dozen countries across the EU. The aim is predicting how many different items will be sold in the future for different periods of time. 

This is a time series prediction problem where we need to create predictions for various combinations of different product types and markets. In e-commerce, the sales often depend on the weather, so it will be important to bring additional information from the other API services to factor in. 

With accurate sales predictions on each item for each location the logistics and purchase teams can plan accordingly to avoid bottlenecks in the distribution.

Goal 
Predict the sales for different countries and different types of products.
